        <p>Hi I'm Radek. My name is a shorthand for Radoslaw, the Polish version of the name with 'w' instead of 'v' at the end (unlike in Bulgaria or Croatia, where there is Radoslav). 
        Its root words are 'joy' and 'fame' in Polish, but to be fair, the second part comes obviously from 'Slav', like in Slavic people, not from 'fame'.
        Right, enough about naming conventions, unless they are for JavaScript functions. Welcome to my Founders & Coders Application site!
    </p>

          <p> I have been an admirer of the idea behind Founders and Coders as well as the way it's run since I learned about it several years ago. The meetings create an invaluable preparation to thrive in a work environment
        and I have enjoyed them greatly. I found it really enlightening to listen to current programme participants talking about their 'sprints' to accomplish defined tasks. 
        In current times, the online meetings helped me to stay focused and to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  
        In the past I attended meetings at Studio 4 and was close to getting a place in 2017 cohort. During my preparations I listened to the FAC podcast and read all interviews with the founder of FAC that I could find online. 
        I remember thinking that Dan is actually the anonymous artist Banksy. The artist is from Bristol and also is active in the Middle East.

          <p> A little about me, I came to London over a decade ago to finish my MSc degree in biotechnology, which then led me to a job as a research assistant at a company developing PCR kits for detection of specific mutations in cancer cells. 
        The projects I was involved in required using many bioinformatic tools which sparked my interest in programming. 

        My interests resulted in a simple side-hustle website, to which the response I received was beyond what I expected. The attention in blog posts and articles from influencers made me feel like a small-scale celebrity. 
        With negligible budget and careful keyword planning on Google's Adwords I was able to increase the number of unique visitors to 1000+ per day. The experience has taught me how powerful the skills in web development and online marketing can be. 
        Especially for passionate individuals with ideas.

        <p> From a wider perspective, what attracts me to FAC is its wholesomeness. The programme equips you with a range of hard-to-get skills that will come at hand for the rest of your life. To be a founder you need vision, imagination, creativity. 
        These are the tasks of the right brain hemisphere. To be a coder you need perseverance, organizational skills, an analytical mind, attention to detail - the tasks of the left side of the brain. Combining the two is a recipe for the 'yin yang',
        a state where meaningful paths await, whether through a career in tech or in entrepreneurship.
