        <p>Hi I'm Radek. My name is a shorthand for Radoslaw, the Polish version of the name with 'w' instead of 'v' at the end (unlike in Bulgaria or Croatia, where there is Radoslav). 
        Its root words are 'joy' and 'fame' in Polish, but to be fair, the second part comes obviously from 'Slav', like in Slavic people, not from 'fame'.
        Right, enough about naming conventions, unless they are for JavaScript functions. Welcome to my Founders & Coders Application site!
    </p>

          <p> I have been an admirer of the idea behind Founders and Coders as well as the way it's run since I learned about it several years ago. The meetings create an invaluable preparation to thrive in a work environment
        and I have enjoyed them greatly. I found it really enlightening to listen to current programme participants talking about their 'sprints' to accomplish defined tasks. 
        In current times, the online meetings helped me to stay focused and to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  
        In the past I attended meetings at Studio 4 and was close to getting a place in 2017 cohort. During my preparations I listened to the FAC podcast and read all interviews with the founder of FAC that I could find online. 
        I remember thinking that Dan is actually the anonymous artist Banksy. Especially after learning about their links with Bristol and work projects in the Middle East. 
               -------JS image carousel with photos: Banksy's ugliest view hotel, art, me doing a handstand at Trafalgar Square, me in the laboratory ----

        <p> From a wider perspective, what attracts me to FAC is its wholesomeness. The programme equips you with a range of hard-to-get skills that will come at hand for the rest of your life. To be a founder you need vision, imagination, creativity. 
        These are the tasks of the right brain hemisphere. To be a coder you need perseverance, organizational skills, an analytical mind, attention to detail - the tasks of the left side of the brain. Combining the two is a recipe for the 'yin yang',
        a state where meaningful paths await, whether through a career in tech or in entrepreneurship.

          <p> A little about me, I came to London over a decade ago to finish my MSc degree in biotechnology, which then led me to a job as a research assistant at a company developing PCR kits for detection of specific mutations in cancer cells. 
        The projects I was involved in required using many bioinformatic tools which sparked my interest in programming. 

        My interests resulted in a simple side-hustle website, to which the response I received was beyond what I expected. The attention in blog posts and articles from influencers made me feel like a small-scale celebrity. 
        With negligible budget and careful keyword planning on Google's Adwords I was able to increase the number of unique visitors to 1000+ per day. The experience has taught me how powerful the skills in web development and online marketing can be. 
        Especially for passionate individuals with ideas.

        <p>I am so happy to have completed the FAC application. I have learnt so much already, from HTML and CSS to Javascript and this is just the start. When I first heard the term software developer it sounded like a dark mystical art. Donâ€™t get me wrong sometimes it still feels like a mystic art, the difference now is, I have had a peek behind the curtain. What I have learnt is that for every coding problem there is a multitude of solutions or a work around. There isnâ€™t one way of working or fixing problems, thinking outside the box and collaboration with others can fruit great solutions. Also coding isnâ€™t as solitary as it is portrayed, thereâ€™s a great developing community online and within FAC, focused on helping each other, which in turn means as a developer, you are never alone. This site is just the beginning of my coding journey and Iâ€™m excited to see where it will lead.

Iâ€™ll close on a reddit comment by Ray85g on a programming thread. â€™Being a developer is constantly feeling stupid because you canâ€™t solve a problem and then feeling like a genius when you do, and nobody caresâ€™ ðŸ˜‚</p>
