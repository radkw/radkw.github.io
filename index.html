Hi, welcome to my Github page! </h1>
  <p>I'm Radek, an aspiring bioinformatician. 
Having background in biotechnology (an MSc degree plus some years of lab work on the genetics of cancer),
    I want to use programming skills for tackling big data problems, such as analysis of genetic data. 
    With machines and automation taking over the world, I see programming as increasingly important role in the society,
    possibly one of the last remaining ones... Which is okay, considering that technology will enable us to live long,
    happy and healthy lives, if used right.
Feel free to have a look at my solutions on Codewars and Freecodecamp or contact me directly: </p>
