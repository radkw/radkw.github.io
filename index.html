Hi, welcome to my Github page! </h1>
  <p class="white-text">I'm Radek, an aspiring bioinformatician. 
With a background in biotechnology (an MSc degree plus some years of lab work on the genetics of cancer),
    I want to develop programming skills to tackle big data problems, such as analysis of genetic data. 
    With IT and automation taking over the world, programming is having an increasingly important role in society, one that allows us to live happy, long and healthy lives!
Please feel free to have a look at my solutions on Codewars and Freecodecamp or contact me directly:
